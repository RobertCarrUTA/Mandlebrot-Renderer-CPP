    In pseudocode, this algorithm would look as follows. The algorithm does not use complex numbers and manually simulates
    complex-number operations using two real numbers, for those who do not have a complex data type. The program may be simplified
    if the programming language includes complex-data-type operations.

    for each pixel (Px, Py) on the screen do
        x0 := scaled x coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot X scale (-2.00, 0.47))
        y0 := scaled y coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot Y scale (-1.12, 1.12))
        x := 0.0
        y := 0.0
        iteration := 0
        max_iteration := 1000
        while (x*x + y*y â‰¤ 2*2 AND iteration < max_iteration) do
            xtemp := x*x - y*y + x0
            y := 2*x*y + y0
            x := xtemp
