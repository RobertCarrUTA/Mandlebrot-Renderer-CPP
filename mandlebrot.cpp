    In pseudocode, this algorithm would look as follows. The algorithm does not use complex numbers and manually simulates
    complex-number operations using two real numbers, for those who do not have a complex data type. The program may be simplified
    if the programming language includes complex-data-type operations.

        y0 := scaled y coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot Y scale (-1.12, 1.12))
