## About the project
Using C++, this project aims to render Mandelbrot images and display the results in the PPM format (**this is a self-study project**, so no tutorials were followed). I have always loved the Mandlebrot set. It is fun to explore and mess around with the images, and the images can be beautiful. Moreover, the Mandelbrot set is a great way to test multithreading and how far a program can be pushed to use a system's memory and its processing power when rendering highly detailed and large images (especially in higher precision parts of the set).

## What is the Mandlebrot Set?
Information for the Mandlebrot Set can be found by clicking [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).

## Other Mandlebrot Softwares You Should Use
Mandlebrot tools I like to use:
 * [The online Mandlebrot viewer](https://math.hws.edu/eck/js/mandelbrot/MB.html) (seriously, check this one out)
 * [Mandlebrot Explorer](https://www.mandel.org.uk/) (not online but you can go a little higher on the rendering resoultions)
